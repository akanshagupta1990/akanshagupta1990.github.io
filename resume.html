				<p>I am UI/UX Designer with 4 years of experience, currently a Masterâ€™s student of Human-Computer Interaction at Georgia Institute of Technology, and <strong>am looking for internships starting May 2017.  </strong>I have deep skills in Information Architecture, Interaction Design, and Interface Prototyping and a broad understanding of Design Research, Visual Design, and Front-end Development.</p>
				<p>Before coming to Georgia Tech, I have worked with multiple startups and design studios, both in full-time and consulting roles. In many of those roles, I have led the end-to-end design process from conception to launch. I am comfortable doing both systems-level thinking and pixel-level work. User needs serve as the North Star in my process, and I strive to perfect projects to the last detail. I am excited by interdisciplinary teams, involvement throughout the project, thought through execution, positive real-world impact, leadership and entrepreneurship, and learning something completely new.</p>
				<p>Outside of work, I have traveled and solo-backpacked in 11 countries and have been teaching Hatha Yoga since 2015. </p>
